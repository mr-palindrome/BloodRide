# BloodRide
## Solution Challenge 2023

### Problem Statement
Despite the vital role that blood transfusions play in healthcare, finding enough willing unpaid donors to meet demand is difficult due to the current shortage. Given that the capacity of the healthcare system and its coverage of the population play a role in how much blood is needed nationally, the existing reliance on voluntary blood donations is insufficient to meet those needs. Due to a lack of blood donors, patients may not receive timely or effective care, which can lower their quality of life and shorten their lifespan. To ensure the prompt and sufficient supply of blood for patients in need, an innovative solution is therefore required to increase the number of volunteer, unpaid blood donors.
